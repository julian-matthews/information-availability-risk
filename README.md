# The availability of non-instrumental information increases decision-making under risk.

> Contemporary models of decision-making under risk focus on estimating the final value of each alternative course of action. According to such frameworks, information that has no capacity to alter a future payoff (i.e., is ‘non-instrumental’) should have little effect on one’s preference for risk. Importantly, however, recent work has shown that information, despite being non-instrumental, may nevertheless exert a striking influence on behavior. Here, we tested whether the opportunity to passively observe the sequence of events following a decision could modulate risky behavior, even if that information could not possibly influence the final result. Across three experiments, 71 individuals chose to accept or reject gambles on a five-window slot machine. If a gamble was accepted, each window was sequentially revealed prior to the outcome being declared. Critically, we informed participants about which windows would subsequently provide veridical information about the gamble outcome, should that gamble be accepted. Our analyses revealed three key findings. First, the opportunity to observe the consequences of one’s choice significantly increased the likelihood of gambling, despite that information being entirely non-instrumental. Second, this effect generalized across different stakes. Finally, choices were driven by the likelihood that the available information could result in an earlier resolution of uncertainty. These findings demonstrate the capacity of non-instrumental information to modulate economic decisions through its anticipatory utility. More broadly, our result provides a counterpoint to current decision-making frameworks, by demonstrating that information that is entirely orthogonal to the value of the final outcome can have substantial effects on risky behavior.

## What is this?
Here we provide R code and complete trial-by-trial data supporting our study of non-instrumental information availability and risky decision-making. We used a **five-window slot machine with fixed odds** (50% chance of winning) to study how the opportunity to observe non-instrumental information about outcomes influences the decisions to gamble. Critically, we informed participants about which windows would subsequently provide veridical information about the gamble outcome. Across three experiments (n=71), we found that non-instrumental information availability has a striking affect on behaviour-increasing the propensity to gamble.
